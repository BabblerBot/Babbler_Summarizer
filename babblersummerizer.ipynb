In this chapter, Carroll introduces many of the themes that would later be introduced in the later volumes of the novel. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale The Dodo proposes a Caucus-race, i.e., a race in which everyone must run around a circular course in order to dry themselves. After they have run around the course and are finally all dry, the Dodo declares the race over and points out Alice as the winner. When Alice cannot produce larger creatures to carry the entire box of comfits and treats, she grabs a little bottle labeled \\'Drink Me\\'.

This is followed by a Gryphon, whom the Queen sends to take Alice to see the Mock Turtle. In the croquet-ground, the King, the Queen, and Alice are all playing the game of Pick-A-Prayer. At the end of the first half hour, all the arches have been set free, and all the players except Alice, who is under sentence of execution, have been taken into custody by the soldiers. The Queen leaves off quarreling with the other players and asks Alice if she has ever seen the Mock Turtles Soup. Alice says no, and the Queen says that she will show Alice his history. As they walk off together, the king says, \"You are all pardoned\" , which angers the Queen because she was unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered. They soon come upon a Grouch, lying fast asleep on the sun. It wakes up and watches the Queen till she is out of sight, then it begins to speak to Alice. The two of them get along well, talking about many of the same things but without saying anything directly to each other. Eventually, they come across a Mock Turtle sitting on a rock. The Mock Turtle informs them that he does not know any of their history, so they sit down to hear it. After some time, there is a long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of \"Hjckrrhrh!” from the Gryphoon, and sobbing from the mock turtle. Finally, the queen leaves to find out more information about her past. While she is gone, the Mock Turdle takes Alice to meet the Dentler, a large vegetable, known as a bean.

her older sister and is bored. Suddenly, a White Rabbit runs by her and stops to take out a watch from its pocket. Having never seen one, Alice follows it and falls down a rabbit hole. After falling for a while, she finds herself in a hallway lined with doors. The doors are all locked, so Alice tries and fails to open them. On the second try, she does manage to open one door, which leads to a garden. In the garden, she meets lots of animals, including a dog, a puppy, a mouse, and a bunch of pebbles. She decides to try and figure out how to get rid of some of them, but then realizes that they are all too big. Finally, she comes across a pile of little cakes, which she eats one of. She shrinks down to the size she used to be, and then goes on to explore the rest of the garden. All of the cakes turn out to be pieces of the dead end of a long rope ladder that has been strung across the room. Alice finally gets back to the top-down part of the ladder, where she sees the White Rabbit again. This time, though, he doesn't see her. He just says, \"Oh dear, I shall be caught. Where are my gloves and fan?\" And thus begins the tale of Alice's growing up.\n","Alice finds that her neck has grown so long that she cannot see her shoulders, and when she reaches the top of a tree she sees a pigeon flying at her. The pigeon flies into her face and starts beating her with its wings, yelling, \"I'm not a serpent!\" Alice indignantly tries to leave the pigeon alone, but the pigeon continues until it stops beating her and tells her that it has been trying to escape from all of the plants and animals that live in the garden. It then goes on to tell her that they are all called \"serpents\" because no matter what you do, they will eventually come crawling out of the earth and bite you. Alice finally manages to get her neck over the edge of a bunch of green leaves and is surprised to see that her shoulders have turned into a snake-like length of neck. She is just about to dive into the green when a pigeon flies up and hits her. A sharp hiss makes her realize that it is a pigeon. She quickly pulls herself back down to the level of the green leaves again only to be attacked by a large bird. This time, however, she does not fly away as the pigeon did, but instead picks up a piece of mushroom and nibbles at it until she is able to raise herself up to her proper height. In this manner, she comes upon an open space where there is a little house about four feet tall. As she approaches the house, a footman wearing a livery suit of croquet shoes comes out of nowhere and knocks on the door. Two other footmen come out of their houses and join the footman. They are the Duke and the Duchess. The Duchess offers to teach Alice how to fetch food and drink for the duke and the dauphin. The duchess gives Alice a great deal of trouble getting the correct answer to every question, which leads to a long series of misunderstandings between the two parties. Finally, after much fruitless conversation, the dukedom runs out of control, and the queen orders the executioner to bring Alice to the scene of the crime. Once there, Alice discovers that she has been sentenced to death for having skipped her turn in the game. Just as she is about to walk away, she spots the Cheshire cat sitting on a nearby tree. The Cheshire Cat explains to her that everything has a moral, and even the cat's actions have a moral. After some discussion, Alice agrees to help the cat, who informs her that she can go anywhere in the world as long as she walks in a straight line. However, if she keeps going too fast, the cat will grow tired of her and die. Thus, she must keep going at a constant speed or else she will never reach the end of her sentence. On the way to the Queen's croquet-garden, Alice encounters the March Hare playing croquet with several other players. The croquet game takes place on a grassy knoll with a number of arches made of various types of plant material. At one point, the croquet match is interrupted by the arrival of the Duchess, followed shortly thereafter by the Duke, the Duchess's three children, and then by the Duchess herself. All of the various members of the party engage in a round of silly wordplay, trading insults and puns until the Duchess finally asks Alice to intercede on her behalf. When the Duchess learns that Alice has been invited to the Croquet-Party, she sends Alice off to find out more about it. While the Duchess is gone, Alice talks to the hat-daddy, the Dodger, who seems to be a sort of jack-of-all-trades. The Hat-Dodger turns out to be the Duchess' pet hedgehog, whom she has named Dormouse. Overcome with curiosity, Alice attempts to learn more about Dormouses habits, and soon finds out that Dormuggin is very fond of telling stories. Soon enough, she also learns that the Duchess plans to take the baby home to be reared as her pet pig. Upon finding this out, Alice is concerned that the baby will be ugly, so she decides to give it a bath before giving it to it. Before doing so, she meets the Duchess talking to the dog, who shows her a picture of a dead rat. Alice realizes that the rat looks exactly like a rat, which reminds her that rats are not supposed to eat things that have holes in them. The next morning, Alice goes to visit the Duchess expecting to find the Duchess cooking breakfast. Instead, she finds the Duchess reading a letter addressed to her from the king. The letter instructs the Duchess to prepare a hot oatmeal porridge for the family. Alice immediately wants to know why the Duchess would ever want to cook such a simple breakfast for the entire family, and questions the Duchess about the meaning of the letter. To the confusion of the reader, the answers to many of the questions are: 1) rabbits don't eat\n","The Queen orders Alice to go visit the Mock Turtle and learn about his history. On the way, she mentions that the people who have been executed by the Queen have been pardoned, which is good news for Alice since she had been worried about how many executions the Queen was going to execute. The Queen sends Alice to meet the Mock turtle and then goes back to her own court, but leaves Alice alone with him. They soon find that he has been ordered to sit on a ledge and tell his story. After much crying and lots of sighing, the mock turtle finally finishes his tale. He begins by saying that he used to be a real Turtle, but now he is pretending to be one of the modern school animals. Then he tells his story: as a schoolboy, he and the other school animals went to school under the master of the sea, whose name was Tortoise. The school animals were taught all sorts of things, including Mystery, Mystery, Seaography, Drawling, Drawing, Stretcher, Fainting, and Coils. At the end of each lesson, they would practice some of the things they learned in school, such as Driving, Driving, Jumping, Eating, and Sewing. Next up on the docket is a trial for the murder of the Duchess of Gloucester. There are two kinds of evidence: the circumstantial and the deliberate. In the frivolous case, there is a paper made up of pieces of paper with no names on it, which seems to be addressed to no one particular person or entity. The whole court is confused about what the paper even means. Finally, the Duchess gets up and announces that she knows the answer to every question correctly. This makes everyone very happy. The Duchess tries to sing at the beginning of the trial, but can't get the words right. She does, however, manage to sing \"Beautiful soup\". Now we get a description of the courtroom scene. It's like watching a movie version of CSI: Cuckoo's Nest except instead of cops and robbers it's a courtroom scene full of fancy-pants lawyers arguing over who gets to represent the family in criminal trials. Everyone is having a good time until the Duchess gives up and says she doesn't want to see any more. And then out of nowhere comes the word \"disease.\" Brain Snack: Disease is often thought of as a disease that causes people to become ill, not something that just happens. Some studies believe that if you have enough sugar in your diet it will make you sick. If you have too much sugar, though, you might get lupine fever. Or, if you've got too much alcohol, maybe you'll develop rheumatism. But most commonly, people get sick from being overindulgent and overeating. Just recently, an outbreak of food poisoning led to the deaths of several members of Parliament, including the Speaker of the House of Representative, the Majority Leader, and the speaker of the Senate. Back when Dickens wrote this book, Ted Nugent was running for President. A guy named Theodore Roosevelt wants to take Ted aside and ask him to write Ted's views on evolution so he can put it into a book called The Discovery of Arithmetic. Ted agrees to do it. Ted takes Ted aside after agreeing to let Alice read the sections of the new edition of the New Testament that Ted has added to the text. First, Ted talks about how evolution is taking place in the early stages of the Bible. Then, Ted asks Alice to read Genesis 9:16-9:19. When she reads the section about evolution, she realizes that God is showing her the door to the possibility of human freedom. Later, she reads another part of the chapter where God shows her the doorway to the Garden of Eden.\n"]}],"source":["from textsum.summarize import Summarizer\n","\n","model_name = \"pszemraj/led-large-book-summary\"\n","summarizer = Summarizer(\n","    model_name_or_path=model_name,  # you can use any Seq2Seq model on the Hub\n","    token_batch_length=15000,  # tokens to batch summarize at a time, up to 16384\n",")\n","long_string = \"\\n\".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])\n","out_str = summarizer.summarize_string(long_string)\n","print(f\"summary: {out_str}\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
