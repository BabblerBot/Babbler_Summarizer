Saturday, March 1, 1788\\n\\nMADISON\\n\\nTo the People of the State of New York:\\n\\nA FIFTH desideratum, illustrating the utility of a senate, is the want\\nof a due sense of national character. Without a select and stable\\nmember of the government, the esteem of foreign powers will not only be\\nforfeited by an unenlightened and variable policy, proceeding from the\\ncauses already mentioned, but the national councils will not possess\\nthat sensibility to the opinion of the world, which is perhaps not\\nless necessary in order to merit, than it is to obtain, its respect and\\nconfidence.\\n\\nAn attention to the judgment of other nations is important to every\\ngovernment for two reasons: the one is, that, independently of the\\nmerits of any particular plan or measure, it is desirable, on various\\naccounts, that it should appear to other nations as the offspring of\\na wise and honorable policy; the second is, that in doubtful cases,\\nparticularly where the national councils may be warped by some strong\\npassion or momentary interest, the presumed or known opinion of the\\nimpartial world may be the best guide that can be followed. What has not\\nAmerica lost by her want of character with foreign nations; and how\\nmany errors and follies would she not have avoided, if the justice and\\npropriety of her measures had, in every instance, been previously tried\\nby the light in which they would probably appear to the unbiased part of\\nmankind?\\n\\nYet however requisite a sense of national character may be, it is\\nevident that it can never be sufficiently possessed by a numerous\\nand changeable body. It can only be found in a number so small that a\\nsensible degree of the praise and blame of public measures may be the\\nportion of each individual; or in an assembly so durably invested with\\npublic trust, that the pride and consequence of its members may\\nbe sensibly incorporated with the reputation and prosperity of the\\ncommunity. The half-yearly representatives of Rhode Island would\\nprobably have been little affected in their deliberations on the\\niniquitous measures of that State, by arguments drawn from the light in\\nwhich such measures would be viewed by foreign nations, or even by the\\nsister States; whilst it can scarcely be doubted that if the concurrence\\nof a select and stable body had been necessary, a regard to national\\ncharacter alone would have prevented the calamities under which that\\nmisguided people is now laboring.\\n\\nI add, as a SIXTH defect the want, in some important cases, of a due\\nresponsibility in the government to the people, arising from\\nthat frequency of elections which in other cases produces this\\nresponsibility. This remark will, perhaps, appear not only new, but\\nparadoxical. It must nevertheless be acknowledged, when explained, to be\\nas undeniable as it is important.\\n\\nResponsibility, in order to be reasonable, must be limited to objects\\nwithin the power of the responsible party, and in order to be effectual,\\nmust relate to operations of that power, of which a ready and proper\\njudgment can be formed by the constituents. The objects of government\\nmay be divided into two general classes: the one depending on measures\\nwhich have singly an immediate and sensible operation; the other\\ndepending on a succession of well-chosen and well-connected measures,\\nwhich have a gradual and perhaps unobserved operation. The importance of\\nthe latter description to the collective and permanent welfare of every\\ncountry, needs no explanation. And yet it is evident that an assembly\\nelected for so short a term as to be unable to provide more than one\\nor two links in a chain of measures, on which the general welfare may\\nessentially depend, ought not to be answerable for the final result,\\nany more than a steward or tenant, engaged for one year, could be\\njustly made to answer for places or improvements which could not be\\naccomplished in less than half a dozen years. Nor is it possible for the\\npeople to estimate the SHARE of influence which their annual assemblies\\nmay respectively have on events resulting from the mixed transactions\\nof several years. It is sufficiently difficult to preserve a personal\\nresponsibility in the members of a NUMEROUS body, for such acts of\\nthe body as have an immediate, detached, and palpable operation on its\\nconstituents.\\n\\nThe proper remedy for this defect must be an additional body in the\\nlegislative department, which, having sufficient permanency to provide\\nfor such objects as require a continued attention, and a train of\\nmeasures, may be justly and effectually answerable for the attainment of\\nthose objects.\\n\\nThus far I have considered the circumstances which point out the\\nnecessity of a well-constructed Senate only as they relate to the\\nrepresentatives of the people. To a people as little blinded by\\nprejudice or corrupted by flattery as those whom I address, I shall not\\nscruple to add, that such an institution may be sometimes necessary as a\\ndefense to the people against their own temporary errors and delusions.\\nAs the cool and deliberate sense of the community ought, in all\\ngovernments, and actually will, in all free governments, ultimately\\nprevail over the views of its rulers; so there are particular moments in\\npublic affairs when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion,\\nor some illicit advantage, or misled by the artful misrepresentations\\nof interested men, may call for measures which they themselves will\\nafterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn. In these critical\\nmoments, how salutary will be the interference of some temperate and\\nrespectable body of citizens, in order to check the misguided career,\\nand to suspend the blow meditated by the people against themselves,\\nuntil reason, justice, and truth can regain their authority over the\\npublic mind? What bitter anguish would not the people of Athens have\\noften escaped if their government had contained so provident a safeguard\\nagainst the tyranny of their own passions? Popular liberty might then\\nhave escaped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the same citizens\\nthe hemlock on one day and statues on the next.\\n\\nIt may be suggested, that a people spread over an extensive region\\ncannot, like the crowded inhabitants of a small district, be subject\\nto the infection of violent passions, or to the danger of combining\\nin pursuit of unjust measures. I am far from denying that this is a\\ndistinction of peculiar importance. I have, on the contrary,\\nendeavored in a former paper to show, that it is one of the principal\\nrecommendations of a confederated republic. At the same time, this\\nadvantage ought not to be considered as superseding the use of auxiliary\\nprecautions. It may even be remarked, that the same extended situation,\\nwhich will exempt the people of America from some of the dangers\\nincident to lesser republics, will expose them to the inconveniency\\nof remaining for a longer time under the influence of those\\nmisrepresentations which the combined industry of interested men may\\nsucceed in distributing among them.\\n\\nIt adds no small weight to all these considerations, to recollect that\\nhistory informs us of no long-lived republic which had not a senate.\\nSparta, Rome, and Carthage are, in fact, the only states to whom that\\ncharacter can be applied. In each of the two first there was a senate\\nfor life. The constitution of the senate in the last is less known.\\nCircumstantial evidence makes it probable that it was not different in\\nthis particular from the two others. It is at least certain, that it\\nhad some quality or other which rendered it an anchor against popular\\nfluctuations; and that a smaller council, drawn out of the senate,\\nwas appointed not only for life, but filled up vacancies itself. These\\nexamples, though as unfit for the imitation, as they are repugnant to\\nthe genius, of America, are, notwithstanding, when compared with the\\nfugitive and turbulent existence of other ancient republics, very\\ninstructive proofs of the necessity of some institution that will blend\\nstability with liberty. I am not unaware of the circumstances which\\ndistinguish the American from other popular governments, as well\\nancient as modern; and which render extreme circumspection necessary, in\\nreasoning from the one case to the other. But after allowing due weight\\nto this consideration, it may still be maintained, that there are many\\npoints of similitude which render these examples not unworthy of our\\nattention. Many of the defects, as we have seen, which can only be\\nsupplied by a senatorial institution, are common to a numerous assembly\\nfrequently elected by the people, and to the people themselves. There\\nare others peculiar to the former, which require the control of such an\\ninstitution. The people can never wilfully betray their own interests;\\nbut they may possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people;\\nand the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative\\ntrust is lodged in the hands of one body of men, than where the\\nconcurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every\\npublic act.\\n\\nThe difference most relied on, between the American and other republics,\\nconsists in the principle of representation; which is the pivot on\\nwhich the former move, and which is supposed to have been unknown to the\\nlatter, or at least to the ancient part of them. The use which has been\\nmade of this difference, in reasonings contained in former papers,\\nwill have shown that I am disposed neither to deny its existence nor\\nto undervalue its importance. I feel the less restraint, therefore, in\\nobserving, that the position concerning the ignorance of the ancient\\ngovernments on the subject of representation, is by no means precisely\\ntrue in the latitude commonly given to it. Without entering into a\\ndisquisition which here would be misplaced, I will refer to a few known\\nfacts, in support of what I advance.\\n\\nIn the most pure democracies of Greece, many of the executive functions\\nwere performed, not by the people themselves, but by officers elected by\\nthe people, and REPRESENTING the people in their EXECUTIVE capacity.\\n\\nPrior to the reform of Solon, Athens was governed by nine Archons,\\nannually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE AT LARGE. The degree of power delegated\\nto them seems to be left in great obscurity. Subsequent to that period,\\nwe find an assembly, first of four, and afterwards of six hundred\\nmembers, annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE; and PARTIALLY representing them\\nin their LEGISLATIVE capacity, since they were not only associated with\\nthe people in the function of making laws, but had the exclusive right\\nof originating legislative propositions to the people. The senate of\\nCarthage, also, whatever might be its power, or the duration of its\\nappointment, appears to have been ELECTIVE by the suffrages of the\\npeople. Similar instances might be traced in most, if not all the\\npopular governments of antiquity.\\n\\nLastly, in Sparta we meet with the Ephori, and in Rome with the\\nTribunes; two bodies, small indeed in numbers, but annually ELECTED BY\\nTHE WHOLE BODY OF THE PEOPLE, and considered as the REPRESENTATIVES of\\nthe people, almost in their PLENIPOTENTIARY capacity. The Cosmi of Crete\\nwere also annually ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, and have been considered by\\nsome authors as an institution analogous to those of Sparta and Rome,\\nwith this difference only, that in the election of that representative\\nbody the right of suffrage was communicated to a part only of the\\npeople.\\n\\nFrom these facts, to which many others might be added, it is clear that\\nthe principle of representation was neither unknown to the ancients nor\\nwholly overlooked in their political constitutions. The true distinction\\nbetween these and the American governments, lies IN THE TOTAL EXCLUSION\\nOF THE PEOPLE, IN THEIR COLLECTIVE CAPACITY, from any share in the\\nLATTER, and not in the TOTAL EXCLUSION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE\\nPEOPLE from the administration of the FORMER. The distinction,\\nhowever, thus qualified, must be admitted to leave a most advantageous\\nsuperiority in favor of the United States. But to insure to this\\nadvantage its full effect, we must be careful not to separate it\\nfrom the other advantage, of an extensive territory. For it cannot\\nbe believed, that any form of representative government could have\\nsucceeded within the narrow limits occupied by the democracies of\\nGreece.\\n\\nIn answer to all these arguments, suggested by reason, illustrated by\\nexamples, and enforced by our own experience, the jealous adversary of\\nthe Constitution will probably content himself with repeating, that a\\nsenate appointed not immediately by the people, and for the term of\\nsix years, must gradually acquire a dangerous pre-eminence in the\\ngovernment, and finally transform it into a tyrannical aristocracy.\\n\\nTo this general answer, the general reply ought to be sufficient, that\\nliberty may be endangered by the abuses of liberty as well as by the\\nabuses of power; that there are numerous instances of the former as\\nwell as of the latter; and that the former, rather than the latter,\\nare apparently most to be apprehended by the United States. But a more\\nparticular reply may be given.\\n\\nBefore such a revolution can be effected, the Senate, it is to be\\nobserved, must in the first place corrupt itself; must next corrupt the\\nState legislatures; must then corrupt the House of Representatives; and\\nmust finally corrupt the people at large. It is evident that the Senate\\nmust be first corrupted before it can attempt an establishment of\\ntyranny. Without corrupting the State legislatures, it cannot prosecute\\nthe attempt, because the periodical change of members would otherwise\\nregenerate the whole body. Without exerting the means of corruption with\\nequal success on the House of Representatives, the opposition of that\\ncoequal branch of the government would inevitably defeat the attempt;\\nand without corrupting the people themselves, a succession of new\\nrepresentatives would speedily restore all things to their pristine\\norder. Is there any man who can seriously persuade himself that the\\nproposed Senate can, by any possible means within the compass of human\\naddress, arrive at the object of a lawless ambition, through all these\\nobstructions?\\n\\nIf reason condemns the suspicion, the same sentence is pronounced by\\nexperience. The constitution of Maryland furnishes the most apposite\\nexample. The Senate of that State is elected, as the federal Senate will\\nbe, indirectly by the people, and for a term less by one year only\\nthan the federal Senate. It is distinguished, also, by the remarkable\\nprerogative of filling up its own vacancies within the term of its\\nappointment, and, at the same time, is not under the control of any such\\nrotation as is provided for the federal Senate. There are some other\\nlesser distinctions, which would expose the former to colorable\\nobjections, that do not lie against the latter. If the federal Senate,\\ntherefore, really contained the danger which has been so loudly\\nproclaimed, some symptoms at least of a like danger ought by this time\\nto have been betrayed by the Senate of Maryland, but no such symptoms\\nhave appeared. On the contrary, the jealousies at first entertained\\nby men of the same description with those who view with terror the\\ncorrespondent part of the federal Constitution, have been gradually\\nextinguished by the progress of the experiment; and the Maryland\\nconstitution is daily deriving, from the salutary operation of this part\\nof it, a reputation in which it will probably not be rivalled by that of\\nany State in the Union.\\n\\nBut if anything could silence the jealousies on this subject, it ought\\nto be the British example. The Senate there instead of being elected for\\na term of six years, and of being unconfined to particular families\\nor fortunes, is an hereditary assembly of opulent nobles. The House\\nof Representatives, instead of being elected for two years, and by the\\nwhole body of the people, is elected for seven years, and, in very\\ngreat proportion, by a very small proportion of the people. Here,\\nunquestionably, ought to be seen in full display the aristocratic\\nusurpations and tyranny which are at some future period to be\\nexemplified in the United States. Unfortunately, however, for the\\nanti-federal argument, the British history informs us that this\\nhereditary assembly has not been able to defend itself against the\\ncontinual encroachments of the House of Representatives; and that it no\\nsooner lost the support of the monarch, than it was actually crushed by\\nthe weight of the popular branch.\\n\\nAs far as antiquity can instruct us on this subject, its examples\\nsupport the reasoning which we have employed. In Sparta, the Ephori, the\\nannual representatives of the people, were found an overmatch for the\\nsenate for life, continually gained on its authority and finally drew\\nall power into their own hands. The Tribunes of Rome, who were the\\nrepresentatives of the people, prevailed, it is well known, in almost\\nevery contest with the senate for life, and in the end gained the most\\ncomplete triumph over it. The fact is the more remarkable, as unanimity\\nwas required in every act of the Tribunes, even after their number was\\naugmented to ten. It proves the irresistible force possessed by that\\nbranch of a free government, which has the people on its side. To these\\nexamples might be added that of Carthage, whose senate, according to\\nthe testimony of Polybius, instead of drawing all power into its vortex,\\nhad, at the commencement of the second Punic War, lost almost the whole\\nof its original portion.\\n\\nBesides the conclusive evidence resulting from this assemblage of facts,\\nthat the federal Senate will never be able to transform itself, by\\ngradual usurpations, into an independent and aristocratic body, we are\\nwarranted in believing, that if such a revolution should ever happen\\nfrom causes which the foresight of man cannot guard against, the House\\nof Representatives, with the people on their side, will at all times\\nbe able to bring back the Constitution to its primitive form and\\nprinciples. Against the force of the immediate representatives of\\nthe people, nothing will be able to maintain even the constitutional\\nauthority of the Senate, but such a display of enlightened policy, and\\nattachment to the public good, as will divide with that branch of the\\nlegislature the affections and support of the entire body of the people\\nthemselves.\\n\\nPUBLIUS\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n      <td>[{'analysis': 'In order to effectively understand James Madison's argument in this federalist paper, it is necessary to understand the constitution's opponent's critique of the senate. Anti-Federalists argued that the Senate was too powerful and aristocratic. Federal farmer argued that, \"The formation of the senate, and the smallness of the house, being, therefore, the result of our situation, and the actual state of things, the evils which may attend the exercise of many powers in this national government may be considered as without remedy.\" Likewise, Centinel lamented that the Senate is \"the great efficient body in this plan of government\" and that it \"is constitution on the most unequal principles.\" Cincinatus summed up the critique quite well: \"We have seen powers, in every branch of government, in violation of all principle and all safety condensed in this aristocratic senate; we have seen the representative or democratic branch, weakened exactly in proportion to the strengthening of the aristocratic.\" This Federalist paper defends the Senate as providing the wisdom and the stability \"aristocracy virtues\" needed to check the fickle lack of wisdom that Madison predicated would characterize the people's branch of the new government, the lower house. Nor were there other critics lacking who, recognizing that the Constitution ultimately rested on popular consent, who, seeing that despite the ingenious apparatus designed to temper the popular will by introducing into the compound modified monarchial/aristocratic ingredients, could argue that the new Constitution was too democratic to operate effectively as a national government in a country as large and with a population as diverse and the Americans'. One such was William Grayson, who doubted the need of any national government but who felt, if one was to be established, it ought to provide a president and a Senate elected for life terms, these to be balanced by a House of Representative elected triennially. It is significant, therefore, to notice that present day critics of the Constitution argue about the exact nature of the Constitution, just as they did in 1787 and 1788. It is easy to see and disagree on whether the constitution is monarchical, aristocratic, or democratic in its essence. John Adams probably best described the constitution, however, in 1806, writing to Benjamin Rush. Adams, disapproving of Jefferson's style as president, bemoaned the fact that Jefferson and his followers had made the national government \"to all intents and purposes, in virtue, spirit, and effect a democracy.\" -- Alas! \"I once thought,\" sad Adams \"our Constitution was quasi or mixed government.\" An additional important note about this paper is Madison's use of the word \"responsibility.\" According to the Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles the word itself is an American invention, and its first appearance in the language is credited by the OED long discussion of senatorial \"responsibility\" in Federalist Number 63. The word appears four times in two paragraphs, as well as in Hamilton's Number 70 and 77, as the differences between senatorial responsibility, presidential responsibility, and judicial responsibility are discussed in these issues.', 'source': 'gradesaver', 'text': 'Madison continues this essay where he left off, claming that the fifth desire of the utility of a Senate is the \"want of a due sense of national character.\" To any foreign country, it is necessary to have a strong, perceptive senate to ensure respect and confidence.

Yet, however important national character is, the Senate cannot be a numerous and changeable body.

'In this essay, more than any other besides perhaps 51, Madison lays out his philosophy on free government. Madison does not state in the Federalist how the state of nature is abandoned and government created. We may assume, however, that his opinion does not differ here from what has been called the core of his philosophy, namely the compact theory of the foundation of the state. This theory was generally accepted at the time the essays were written, whereas the organic theory was hardly known. Madison adhered to it even when it was being abandoned by most European theorists, and called it a \"fundamental principle of free government.\" Furthermore, the acceptance of the compact theory in the Federalist can be concluded from the fact that Madison, who recognizes a parallel between the formation of the state by individuals and the formation of a confederacy by state, calls the Confederation \"a compact among the States.\" Madison\\'s view on the relation between people and government has important consequences. His conception of government as a means follows not only the primacy of the individual\\'s protection before popular participation in government, but also his Federalist, advocating the Union, can be a treatise on the Union only in a relative sense and must, in an absolute sense, be a treatise for individual rights. His conception of society as an intrastate phenomenon must influence his view on the nature of confederations and the Union. Finally, from the necessity of the independence of the government from the people follows the possibility that government abuses it power. In that case the people, possessing \"the transcendent and precious right . .. . to abolish or alter their governments as to them shall most likely to effect their safety and happiness \" may resort to a revolution. Furthermore, from the subjection of government under a constitution follows the existence of two sorts of man-made law; that by which the government is bound , and that by which the government binds the people . , Madison believed that the individuals, motivated by self-interest, leave the state of nature in order to live under justice in a free government that, primarily, protects their lives, liberty, and property and, to the degree compatible with the security of these rights, permit people to participate in government under a constitution. The main threat to free government arises form its own creation of factions, the control of which is of vital importance. The latter observation has important implications for Madison\\'s inquiry into the compatibility of concrete governments with the ideal free government. In his search for the government that is most likely to realize that ideal, he need only look for a government under which factions are controlled. After Jefferson finished writing \"Notes on the State of Virginia,\" he added a rough draft of a constitution he hoped would be adopted at a state constitutional convention held in 1783. This draft constitution, like everything Jefferson wrote, is original and comprehensive. It is especially pertinent because Jefferson draws our attention to the weaknesses, as well as to the strengths, of a republican form of government. One of his proposals, intended to prevent one branch of government from becoming too powerful, is unique, but the writer has some criticism of it. He recommends that a constitutional convention should be held whenever two branches of government, by a two-thirds vote, desire to change the Constitution or correct any violation in it.',\n 'source':

                           \"Be gay securely;\\n  Dispel, my fair, with smiles, the tim\\'rous clouds,\\n  That hang on thy clear brow.\"\\n\\n  _Death of Agrippina._\\n\\n\\nThe sudden and almost magical change, from the stirring incidents of the\\ncombat to the stillness that now reigned around him, acted on the heated\\nimagination of Heyward like some exciting dream. While all the images\\nand events he had witnessed remained deeply impressed on his memory, he\\nfelt a difficulty in persuading himself of their truth. Still ignorant\\nof the fate of those who had trusted to the aid of the swift current, he\\nat first listened intently to any signal, or sounds of alarm, which\\nmight announce the good or evil fortune of their hazardous undertaking.\\nHis attention was, however, bestowed in vain; for, with the\\ndisappearance of Uncas, every sign of the adventurers had been lost,\\nleaving him in total uncertainty of their fate.\\n\\nIn a moment of such painful doubt, Duncan did not hesitate to look about\\nhim, without consulting that protection from the rocks which just before\\nhad been so necessary to his safety. Every effort, however, to detect\\nthe least evidence of the approach of their hidden enemies, was as\\nfruitless as the inquiry after his late companions. The wooded banks of\\nthe rivers seemed again deserted by everything possessing animal life.\\nThe uproar which had so lately echoed through the vaults of the forest\\nwas gone, leaving the rush of the waters to swell and sink on the\\ncurrents of the air, in the unmingled sweetness of nature. A fish-hawk,\\nwhich, secure on the topmost branches of a dead pine, had been a distant\\nspectator of the fray, now stooped from his high and ragged perch, and\\nsoared, in wide sweeps, above his prey; while a jay, whose noisy voice\\nhad been stilled by the hoarser cries of the savages, ventured again to\\nopen his discordant throat, as though once more in undisturbed\\npossession of his wild domains. Duncan caught from these natural\\naccompaniments of the solitary scene a glimmering of hope; and he began\\nto rally his faculties to renewed exertions, with something like a\\nreviving confidence of success.\\n\\n\"The Hurons are not to be seen,\" he said, addressing David, who had by\\nno means recovered from the effects of the stunning blow he had\\nreceived; \"let us conceal ourselves in the cavern, and trust the rest to\\nProvidence.\"\\n\\n\"I remember to have united with two comely maidens, in lifting up our\\nvoices in praise and thanksgiving,\" returned the bewildered\\nsinging-master; \"since which time I have been visited by a heavy\\njudgment for my sins. I have been mocked with the likeness of sleep,\\nwhile sounds of discord have rent my ears, such as might manifest the\\nfulness of time, and that nature had forgotten her harmony.\"\\n\\n\"Poor fellow! thine own period was, in truth, near its accomplishment!\\nBut arouse, and come with me; I will lead you where all other sounds but\\nthose of your own psalmody shall be excluded.\"\\n\\n\"There is melody in the fall of the cataract, and the rushing of many\\nwaters is sweet to the senses!\" said David, pressing his hand confusedly\\non his brow. \"Is not the air yet filled with shrieks and cries, as\\nthough the departed spirits of the damned--\"\\n\\n\"Not now, not now,\" interrupted the impatient Heyward, \"they have\\nceased, and they who raised them, I trust in God, they are gone too!\\neverything but the water is still and at peace; in, then, where you may\\ncreate those sounds you love so well to hear.\"\\n\\nDavid smiled sadly, though not without a momentary gleam of pleasure, at\\nthis allusion to his beloved vocation. He no longer hesitated to be led\\nto a spot which promised such unalloyed gratification to his wearied\\nsenses; and, leaning on the arm of his companion, he entered the narrow\\nmouth of the cave. Duncan seized a pile of the sassafras, which he drew\\nbefore the passage, studiously concealing every appearance of an\\naperture. Within this fragile barrier he arranged the blankets abandoned\\nby the foresters, darkening the inner extremity of the cavern, while its\\nouter received a chastened light from the narrow ravine, through which\\none arm of the river rushed, to form the junction with its sister\\nbranch, a few rods below.\\n\\n\"I like not that principle of the natives, which teaches them to submit\\nwithout a struggle, in emergencies that appear desperate,\" he said,\\nwhile busied in this employment; \"our own maxim, which says, \\'while life\\nremains there is hope,\\' is more consoling, and better suited to a\\nsoldier\\'s temperament. To you, Cora, I will urge no words of idle\\nencouragement; your own fortitude and undisturbed reason will teach you\\nall that may become your sex; but cannot we dry the tears of that\\ntrembling weeper on your bosom?\"\\n\\n\"I am calmer, Duncan,\" said Alice, raising herself from the arms of her\\nsister, and forcing an appearance of composure through her tears; \"much\\ncalmer, now. Surely, in this hidden spot we are safe, we are secret,\\nfree from injury; we will hope everything from those generous men who\\nhave risked so much already in our behalf.\"\\n\\n\"Now does our gentle Alice speak like a daughter of Munro!\" said\\nHeyward, pausing to press her hand as he passed towards the outer\\nentrance of the cavern. \"With two such examples of courage before him, a\\nman would be ashamed to prove other than a hero.\" He then seated himself\\nin the centre of the cavern, grasping his remaining pistol with a hand\\nconvulsively clenched, while his contracted and frowning eye announced\\nthe sullen desperation of his purpose. \"The Hurons, if they come, may\\nnot gain our position so easily as they think,\" he lowly muttered; and\\ndropping his head back against the rock, he seemed to await the result\\nin patience, though his gaze was unceasingly bent on the open avenue to\\ntheir place of retreat.\\n\\nWith the last sound of his voice, a deep, a long, and almost breathless\\nsilence succeeded. The fresh air of the morning had penetrated the\\nrecess, and its influence was gradually felt on the spirits of its\\ninmates. As minute after minute passed by, leaving them in undisturbed\\nsecurity, the insinuating feeling of hope was gradually gaining\\npossession of every bosom, though each one felt reluctant to give\\nutterance to expectations that the next moment might so fearfully\\ndestroy.\\n\\nDavid alone formed an exception to these varying emotions. A gleam of\\nlight from the opening crossed his wan countenance, and fell upon the\\npages of the little volume, whose leaves he was again occupied in\\nturning, as if searching for some song more fitted to their condition\\nthan any that had yet met his eye. He was, most probably, acting all\\nthis time under a confused recollection of the promised consolation of\\nDuncan. At length, it would seem, his patient industry found its reward;\\nfor, without explanation or apology, he pronounced aloud the words \"Isle\\nof Wight,\" drew a long, sweet sound from his pitch-pipe, and then ran\\nthrough the preliminary modulations of the air, whose name he had just\\nmentioned with the sweeter tones of his own musical voice.\\n\\n\"May not this prove dangerous?\" asked Cora, glancing her dark eye at\\nMajor Heyward.\\n\\n\"Poor fellow! his voice is too feeble to be heard amid the din of the\\nfalls,\" was the answer; \"besides, the cavern will prove his friend. Let\\nhim indulge his passion, since it may be done without hazard.\"\\n\\n\"Isle of Wight!\" repeated David, looking about him with that dignity\\nwith which he had long been wont to silence the whispering echoes of his\\nschool; \"\\'tis a brave tune, and set to solemn words; let it be sung with\\nmeet respect!\"\\n\\nAfter allowing a moment of stillness, to enforce his discipline, the\\nvoice of the singer was heard, in low, murmuring syllables, gradually\\nstealing on the ear, until it filled the narrow vault with sounds\\nrendered trebly thrilling by the feeble and tremulous utterance produced\\nby his debility. The melody, which no weakness could destroy, gradually\\nwrought its sweet influence on the senses of those who heard it. It even\\nprevailed over the miserable travesty of the song of David which the\\nsinger had selected from a volume of similar effusions, and caused the\\nsense to be forgotten in the insinuating harmony of the sounds. Alice\\nunconsciously dried her tears, and bent her melting eyes on the pallid\\nfeatures of Gamut with an expression of chastened delight that she\\nneither affected nor wished to conceal. Cora bestowed an approving smile\\non the pious efforts of the namesake of the Jewish prince, and Heyward\\nsoon turned his steady, stern look from the outlet of the cavern, to\\nfasten it, with a milder character, on the face of David, or to meet the\\nwandering beams which at moments strayed from the humid eyes of Alice.\\nThe open sympathy of the listeners stirred the spirit of the votary of\\nmusic, whose voice regained its richness and volume, without losing that\\ntouching softness which proved its secret charm. Exerting his renovated\\npowers to their utmost, he was yet filling the arches of the cave with\\nlong and full tones, when a yell burst into the air without, that\\ninstantly stilled his pious strains, choking his voice suddenly, as\\nthough his heart had literally bounded into the passage of his throat.\\n\\n\"We are lost!\" exclaimed Alice, throwing herself into the arms of Cora.\\n\\n\"Not yet, not yet,\" returned the agitated but undaunted Heyward; \"the\\nsound came from the centre of the island, and it has been produced by\\nthe sight of their dead companions. We are not yet discovered, and there\\nis still hope.\"\\n\\nFaint and almost despairing as was the prospect of escape, the words of\\nDuncan were not thrown away, for it awakened the powers of the sisters\\nin such a manner that they awaited the result in silence. A second yell\\nsoon followed the first, when a rush of voices was heard pouring down\\nthe island, from its upper to its lower extremity, until they reached\\nthe naked rock above the caverns, where, after a shout of savage\\ntriumph, the air continued full of horrible cries and screams, such as\\nman alone can utter, and he only when in a state of the fiercest\\nbarbarity.\\n\\nThe sounds quickly spread around them in every direction. Some called to\\ntheir fellows from the water\\'s edge, and were answered from the heights\\nabove. Cries were heard in the startling vicinity of the chasm between\\nthe two caves, which mingled with hoarser yells that arose out of the\\nabyss of the deep ravine. In short, so rapidly had the savage sounds\\ndiffused themselves over the barren rock, that it was not difficult for\\nthe anxious listeners to imagine they could be heard beneath, as in\\ntruth they were above and on every side of them.\\n\\nIn the midst of this tumult, a triumphant yell was raised within a few\\nyards of the hidden entrance to the cave. Heyward abandoned every hope,\\nwith the belief it was the signal that they were discovered. Again the\\nimpression passed away, as he heard the voices collect near the spot\\nwhere the white man had so reluctantly abandoned his rifle. Amid the\\njargon of the Indian dialects that he now plainly heard, it was easy to\\ndistinguish not only words, but sentences, in the _patois_ of the\\nCanadas. A burst of voices had shouted simultaneously, \"La Longue\\nCarabine!\" causing the opposite woods to re-echo with a name which,\\nHeyward well remembered, had been given by his enemies to a celebrated\\nhunter and scout of the English camp, and who, he now learnt for the\\nfirst time, had been his late companion.\\n\\n\"La Longue Carabine! La Longue Carabine!\" passed from mouth to mouth,\\nuntil the whole band appeared to be collected around a trophy which\\nwould seem to announce the death of its formidable owner. After a\\nvociferous consultation, which was, at times, deafened by bursts of\\nsavage joy, they again separated, filling the air with the name of a\\nfoe, whose body, Heyward could collect from their expressions, they\\nhoped to find concealed in some crevice of the island.\\n\\n\"Now,\" he whispered to the trembling sisters, \"now is the moment of\\nuncertainty! if our place of retreat escape this scrutiny, we are still\\nsafe! In every event, we are assured, by what has fallen from our\\nenemies, that our friends have escaped, and in two short hours we may\\nlook for succor from Webb.\"\\n\\nThere were now a few minutes of fearful stillness, during which Heyward\\nwell knew that the savages conducted their search with greater vigilance\\nand method. More than once he could distinguish their footsteps, as they\\nbrushed the sassafras, causing the faded leaves to rustle, and the\\nbranches to snap. At length, the pile yielded a little, a corner of the\\nblanket fell, and a faint ray of light gleamed into the inner part of\\nthe cave. Cora folded Alice to her bosom in agony, and Duncan sprang to\\nhis feet. A shout was at that moment heard, as if issuing from the\\ncentre of the rock, announcing that the neighboring cavern had at length\\nbeen entered. In a minute, the number and loudness of the voices\\nindicated that the whole party was collected in and around that secret\\nplace.\\n\\nAs the inner passages to the two caves were so close to each other,\\nDuncan, believing that escape was no longer possible, passed David and\\nthe sisters, to place himself between the latter and the first onset of\\nthe terrible meeting. Grown desperate by his situation, he drew nigh the\\nslight barrier which separated him only by a few feet from his\\nrelentless pursuers, and placing his face to the casual opening, he even\\nlooked out, with a sort of desperate indifference, on their movements.\\n\\nWithin reach of his arm was the brawny shoulder of a gigantic Indian,\\nwhose deep and authoritative voice appeared to give directions to the\\nproceedings of his fellows. Beyond him again, Duncan could look into the\\nvault opposite, which was filled with savages, upturning and rifling the\\nhumble furniture of the scout. The wound of David had dyed the leaves of\\nsassafras with a color that the natives well knew was anticipating the\\nseason. Over this sign of their success, they set up a howl, like an\\nopening from so many hounds who had recovered a lost trail. After this\\nyell of victory, they tore up the fragrant bed of the cavern, and bore\\nthe branches into the chasm, scattering the boughs, as if they suspected\\nthem of concealing the person of the man they had so long hated and\\nfeared. One fierce and wild-looking warrior approached the chief\\nbearing a load of the brush, and pointing, exultingly, to the deep red\\nstains with which it was sprinkled, uttered his joy in Indian yells,\\nwhose meaning Heyward was only enabled to comprehend by the frequent\\nrepetition of the name of \"La Longue Carabine!\" When his triumph had\\nceased, he cast the brush on the slight heap that Duncan had made before\\nthe entrance of the second cavern, and closed the view. His example was\\nfollowed by others, who, as they drew the branches from the cave of the\\nscout, threw them into one pile, adding, unconsciously, to the security\\nof those they sought. The very slightness of the defence was its chief\\nmerit, for no one thought of disturbing a mass of brush, which all of\\nthem believed, in that moment of hurry and confusion, had been\\naccidentally raised by the hands of their own party.\\n\\nAs the blankets yielded before the outward pressure, and the branches\\nsettled in the fissure of the rock by their own weight, forming a\\ncompact body, Duncan once more breathed freely. With a light step, and\\nlighter heart, he returned to the centre of the cave, and took the place\\nhe had left, where he could command a view of the opening next the\\nriver. While he was in the act of making this movement, the Indians, as\\nif changing their purpose by a common impulse, broke away from the\\ncavern in a body, and were heard rushing up the island again, towards\\nthe point whence they had originally descended. Here another wailing cry\\nbetrayed that they were again collected around the bodies of their dead\\ncomrades.\\n\\nDuncan now ventured to look at his companions; for, during the most\\ncritical moments of their danger, he had been apprehensive that the\\nanxiety of his countenance might communicate some additional alarm to\\nthose who were so little able to sustain it.\\n\\n\"They are gone, Cora!\" he whispered; \"Alice, they are returned whence\\nthey came, and we are saved! To Heaven, that has alone delivered us from\\nthe grasp of so merciless an enemy, be all the praise!\"\\n\\n\"Then to Heaven will I return my thanks!\" exclaimed the younger sister,\\nrising from the encircling arms of Cora, and casting herself with\\nenthusiastic gratitude on the naked rock; \"to that Heaven who has spared\\nthe tears of a gray-headed father; has saved the lives of those I so\\nmuch love--\"\\n\\nBoth Heyward, and the more tempered Cora, witnessed the act of\\ninvoluntary emotion with powerful sympathy, the former secretly\\nbelieving that piety had never worn a form so lovely as it had now\\nassumed in the youthful person of Alice. Her eyes radiant with the glow\\nof grateful feelings; the flush of her beauty was again seated on her\\ncheeks, and her whole soul seemed ready and anxious to pour out its\\nthanksgivings, through the medium of her eloquent features. But when her\\nlips moved, the words they should have uttered appeared frozen by some\\nnew and sudden chill. Her bloom gave place to the paleness of death; her\\nsoft and melting eyes grew hard, and seemed contracting with horror;\\nwhile those hands which she had raised, clasped in each other, towards\\nheaven, dropped in horizontal lines before her, the fingers pointed\\nforward in convulsed motion. Heyward turned, the instant she gave a\\ndirection to his suspicions, and, peering just above the ledge which\\nformed the threshold of the open outlet of the cavern, he beheld the\\nmalignant, fierce, and savage features of Le Renard Subtil.\\n\\nIn that moment of surprise, the self-possession of Heyward did not\\ndesert him. He observed by the vacant expression of the Indian\\'s\\ncountenance, that his eye, accustomed to the open air, had not yet been\\nable to penetrate the dusky light which pervaded the depth of the\\ncavern. He had even thought of retreating beyond a curvature in the\\nnatural wall, which might still conceal him and his companions, when, by\\nthe sudden gleam of intelligence that shot across the features of the\\nsavage, he saw it was too late, and that they were betrayed.\\n\\nThe look of exultation and brutal triumph which announced this terrible\\ntruth was irresistibly irritating. Forgetful of everything but the\\nimpulses of his hot blood, Duncan levelled his pistol and fired. The\\nreport of the weapon made the cavern bellow like an eruption from a\\nvolcano; and when the smoke it vomited had been driven away before the\\ncurrent of air which issued from the ravine, the place so lately\\noccupied by the features of his treacherous guide was vacant. Rushing to\\nthe outlet, Heyward caught a glimpse of his dark figure, stealing around\\na low and narrow ledge, which soon hid him entirely from sight.\\n\\nAmong the savages, a frightful stillness succeeded the explosion, which\\nhad just been heard bursting from the bowels of the rock. But when Le\\nRenard raised his voice in a long and intelligible whoop, it was\\nanswered by a spontaneous yell from the mouth of every Indian within\\nhearing of the sound. The clamorous noises again rushed down the\\nisland; and before Duncan had time to recover from the shock, his feeble\\nbarrier of brush was scattered to the winds, the cavern was entered at\\nboth its extremities, and he and his companions were dragged from their\\nshelter and borne into the day, where they stood surrounded by the whole\\nband of the triumphant Hurons.\\n\\n\\n\\n'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"result[\"predicted_summary\"][0]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-30T12:53:08.307167Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-30T12:53:08.307556Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-30T12:53:08.315305Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-30T12:53:08.307524Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-30T12:53:08.314357Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":91,"outputs":[{"execution_count":91,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"['Heyward tries to convince himself that the Hurons have not attacked them, but they are nowhere to be seen.
